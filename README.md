Functional Views on Android
==============

This project is a simple example that we use in 47 Degrees for our talk `Functional Views on Android`

This application is written entirely in Scala on Android. We are excited to make the application open source and share the code with you. We have used the [macroid](http://macroid.github.io/) library extensively in this project
